## Problem Sheet 3

In this repository we will be taking a look at the Iris data set and investigating its different aspects.
We will then graph the line of best fit and the Gradient Descent.
We will also briefly use the Seaborn library.

## Installing needed technologies

You'll will first need to install Python, this can be done by following this link and its instructions, install Python 3 [Pyton Install](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/)
Make sure Python is in your enviroment variables path.
To check if Python installed properly, open your cmd and type "Python".

You will need the numpy library too, to do so, open your cmd and enter: pip install numpy

Install Jupyter notebook using: pip install jupyter

Install Matplotlib using: pip install matplotlib

Laslty for this example you will need the Seaborn library, open cmd one last time and enter: pip3 install seaborn

## Iris data set

The data set consists of 5 columns and 150 rows.

These columns are:
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width
* Species(setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## Using this repository

git clone https://github.com/Damian404/Jupyter-numpy-and-pyplot.git

Then open Jupyter notebook and open clone
